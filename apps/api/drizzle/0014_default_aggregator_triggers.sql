-- SS-3 (#640) — two triggers on organization.default_for_bindings.
--
-- The default aggregator is nominated by a "direct backend/support request"
-- (product's answer on #640): a hand-written UPDATE, no API. So both the
-- exclusivity rule and the audit trail have to live in the database — an
-- application route would never see the write.
--
-- Custom migration: triggers are not expressible in the drizzle schema, so per
-- apps/api/drizzle/README.md this is hand-written rather than generated.

-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- 1. Exclusivity: no two orgs may be the default for the SAME binding.
--
-- Different aggregators MAY be defaults for different bindings, and that is
-- the expected shape: a user holds exactly one domain (the single-role lock in
-- create_item.ts keeps user.domains at one entry and never grows it), so a
-- seeker aggregator and a provider aggregator can coexist and each owns its own
-- self-signup population.
--
-- What must never happen is two orgs claiming the same binding: the tag this
-- drives (user.onboarded_by_org_id) has one slot per account, and
-- participant_decrypt scopes on it, so a contested binding would hand PII
-- decrypt rights to whichever row a query happened to return first.
--
-- Postgres cannot unique-index an array *element*, and there is no gist opclass
-- for text[] overlap, so this is a trigger rather than a constraint. The
-- advisory lock makes it safe against two concurrent nominations, which would
-- otherwise each see a clear field and both commit.

--
-- A hand-over is two rows (a revoke of A, then a grant to B, because

-- from_org_id = A — recovered from the audit trail itself, since `organization`
-- has already forgotten. So a transfer is self-describing and does not depend
-- on the operator running both statements in one transaction.
--
-- `changed_by` is the Postgres role that ran the statement — the only identity
-- a hand-written UPDATE has. It answers "which role", not "which person": if
-- support shares one application login, that is all the trail can say. Issue
-- individual DB logins if per-operator attribution is needed; that operational
-- control is what makes this audit worth having.
--
-- `changed_by` is the Postgres role that ran the statement, the only identity
-- available for a hand-written UPDATE. `organization` has no `updated_at`, and
-- this column decides which organisation may decrypt an inbound population's
-- PII, so a change with no trace would be unauditable.
