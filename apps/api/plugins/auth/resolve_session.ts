/**
 * Session resolution, shared by `auth_middleware.ts` and `validate_session.ts`
 * so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * Which provider runs is decided entirely by `AUTH_PROVIDER`:
 *
 *   betterauth  the Keycloak branch is not reached at all; the caller falls
 *               through to better-auth's own session handling.
 *   keycloak    Keycloak only. There is no better-auth fallback — a request that
 *               carries no usable Keycloak token is simply unauthenticated.
 *
 * Bearer tokens are a SERVICE channel only (AUTH-VULN-03/04). A human token
 * presented in an `Authorization` header is refused however valid it is: a
 * browser session is the `sid` cookie, resolved by `resolve_browser_session.ts`,
 * which calls this module's `resolveHumanSession` itself.
 *
 * A token that *looks* Keycloak-issued but fails validation is rejected outright
 * rather than passed on. That mattered when a fallback existed (it would have
 * turned a precise failure — "expired", "wrong client" — into a generic 401, and
 * let a rejected token get a second evaluation by another code path), and it is
 * retained now because the precise failure is still the more useful answer.
