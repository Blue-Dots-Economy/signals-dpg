/**
 * Browser login, run server-side (AUTH-VULN-03/04).
 *
 * The SPA used to perform the OIDC code exchange itself and keep the resulting
 * access AND refresh tokens in `localStorage`, where any script on the origin
 * could read them — demonstrated end to end by a pentest, which replayed the
 * refresh token to mint fresh access tokens and called this API with no cookie.
 *
 * These four routes move the whole flow behind the API. The browser only ever
 * holds an opaque `sid` cookie (httpOnly, so script cannot read it at all);
 * tokens live in Redis. This is the model `aggregator-dpg` already runs.
 *
 * The API and the UI are not assumed to be the same origin: locally they are
 * :2742 and :3000, and a deployment may split them across hosts. The browser
 * origin is therefore carried through the flow and validated against the CORS
 * allowlist (`safeAppOrigin`) before anything is redirected to it. Keycloak has
 * to know the API's callback URL as a valid redirect URI for `signals-ui` —
 * already true for `http://localhost:2742/*` in the bundled realm, and covered
 * by `__PUBLIC_BASE_URL__/*` wherever the two share an origin.
 */

/**
 * Declared so the committed spec matches reality. These routes never answer
 * 200: the two browser-facing ones only ever redirect, and all four answer 404
 * when the provider is not Keycloak. A generated client built from a spec that
 * claimed 200 would model a response body that does not exist.

 * on `dev-signals.example` is simply never sent to `portal.example` — the user
 * completes a perfectly good login and lands back unauthenticated.
 *
 * `trustProxy` is enabled (`app.ts`), so `protocol`/`host` reflect the
