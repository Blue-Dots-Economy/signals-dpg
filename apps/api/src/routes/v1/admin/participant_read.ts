/**
 * GET /api/v1/admin/participant
 *
 * Read-only lookup endpoint for both network_service and aggregator acting orgs.
 * Accepts email or phone_number (mutually optional at request level, one required
 * via schema refine). Returns user_id and items if found, filtered by org ownership.
 *
 * For network_service: returns user_id + all items if user exists.
 * For aggregator: returns user_id + items only if user was onboarded by this aggregator,
 *                otherwise returns items: [].
 * For either tier: returns { user_id: null } if user not found.
 *
 * Consent reporting (#692):
 * - `compliance` is a `[{key, value}]` array using the same key vocabulary the
 *   POST body accepts. It replaced `user_consent: {terms_accepted, …}`, which
 *   named one concept two ways and answered in a different shape than it was
 *   written in.
 * - Every `value` is VERSION-SCOPED: `true` only when a row exists at the
 *   document version this instance currently serves. Previously any accepted
 *   version counted, so a participant on a superseded document read as
 *   consented forever and the channel had no way to tell.
 * - A minor is rejected with 400 `U18_NOT_ALLOWED` for voice/network_service
 *   callers (never for aggregators — see the gate for why). An aggregator
 *   therefore DOES read a minor, so the version comparison resolves the u18
 *   document set for one; see `consentVariantForAge`.
 * - `?network=` selects which network's documents define "current"; it defaults
 *   to the served network on a single-network instance, and a value this
 *   instance does not serve is refused (`NETWORK_NOT_SERVED`) rather than
 *   answered all-false.
 *
 * Error responses are intentionally not declared in the route schema, matching
 * the sibling POST /admin/participant, which likewise returns 400s (including
 * its own U18_NOT_ALLOWED) with only its 200 declared.
