/**
 * Fastify preHandler that resolves the acting org for a request.
 *
 * Reads the `x-acting-org-id` header and the apikey-bound user (set upstream
 * by the apikey auth path), validates that the org exists and is one of the
 * types allowed to be asserted as an acting org (`aggregator` | `voice` |
 * `network_service`), and that the service user is a registered member of
 * some org in Signals. On success, attaches `request.acting_org` and resolves.
 *
 * Each error branch responds via the reply and returns early; the request
 * lifecycle is terminated by Fastify when the reply is sent.
 *
 * The signature is declared as a plain async function (rather than typed via
 * Fastify's `preHandlerAsyncHookHandler`) so unit tests can invoke it without
 * binding a FastifyInstance `this`. The runtime shape still satisfies the
 * Fastify preHandler contract.
