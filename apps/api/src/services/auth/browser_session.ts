 * own store, the refresh token — in `localStorage`, where any script on the
 * origin could read both. A pentest lifted them and replayed the refresh token
 * against Keycloak to mint fresh access tokens, then called the API with no
 * cookie at all.
 *
 * The tokens now never reach the browser. They live here, keyed by an opaque
 * session id that is the only thing in the cookie, mirroring the model
 * `aggregator-dpg` already runs ("Tokens are never written to cookies. They
 * live in Redis only").
 *
 * The id is stored HASHED. Redis is shared infrastructure and its keys surface
 * in `KEYS`/`MONITOR` output, backups and support dumps; a raw id there would be
 * a bearer credential sitting in plaintext, which is the shape of the problem
 * this module exists to remove. The cookie carries the raw id, the store only
 * ever sees its SHA-256 — so a leaked key listing cannot be replayed as a login.
