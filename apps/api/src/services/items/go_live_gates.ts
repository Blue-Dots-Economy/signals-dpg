   * SS-3 (#640): a profile may not go live while nobody owns its account.
   *
   * ⚠️ This gate is NOT a pure function of the item's own state, unlike the
   * other two. It reads the prior lifecycle status and instance config, and it
   * lets a `live` profile pass a condition it does not satisfy. That breaks the
   * invariant stated in `classifier.ts`'s header — deliberately, and it is
   * repeated there. Do not "tidy" either guard away:
   *
   * Guard 1 — inert while no default aggregator is configured for this binding.
   *   Product's answer to #640 Q1 is that the default arrives POST-launch: a
   *   real aggregator registers and goes live first, and only then is nominated.
   *   Without this guard, every self-signup profile would be frozen in `draft`
   *   from launch until that happens, so Q1 and Q4 would contradict each other.
   *
   * Guard 2 — blocks `draft → live` only; never demotes a profile that is
   *   already live. `classify_item` re-derives draft↔live on EVERY write, not
   *   just at creation. Without this guard, an already-live user with no
   *   owning aggregator who edits one field of their own profile would be
   *   pushed back to `draft`; the transition publishes an item event and every
   *   `item_search` read path is live-only, so their profile would silently
   *   vanish from discover and the map. No admin action, no warning, across the
   *   whole pre-default self-signup population. This is also what encodes
   *   "new registrations only".
