/**
 * Default-aggregator resolution (#640, SS-3).
 *
 * A user arriving through an uncontrolled inbound path — portal self-signup, or
 * a cold call to the network-hosted voice agent — has no aggregator of their
 * own. `user.onboarded_by_org_id` is the tenancy key for participant reads,
 * action authorisation and **PII decryption**, so leaving it null means nobody
 * is responsible for verifying that person and nobody can decrypt them.
 *
 * The default aggregator is a real, already-approved aggregator org that the
 * network admin nominates by a direct backend/support request — a hand-written
 * UPDATE of `organization.default_for_bindings` (#640's answer; there is no API
 * for it, and the database enforces the rules: a CHECK for `type='aggregator'`,
 * the `organization_default_binding_exclusive` trigger for one org per binding,
 * and an audit trigger so the change is traceable).
 *
 * It is deliberately never system-generated: an org minted by the system has no
 * enabled Keycloak user, so the "unverified queue" it owns would be a queue
 * nobody can open. Note the database can only prove `type = 'aggregator'` —
 * `organization` has no approval/status column, so "already-approved" is a
 * process guarantee the runbook has to carry, not an enforced one.
 *
 * ## Defaults are per binding
 *
 * `organization.default_for_bindings` is per (network, domain) — product asked
 * for a per-domain default (#640 Q3) — so a seeker aggregator and a provider
 * aggregator coexist, each owning its own self-signup population.
 *
 * That is sound even though the tag itself (`user.onboarded_by_org_id`) is per
 * ACCOUNT, because a user holds exactly one domain: the single-role lock in
 * `create_item.ts` keeps `user.domains` at one entry and never grows it. Each
 * account therefore belongs to one binding, and "which org owns this person"
 * has one answer.
 *
 * Two orgs claiming the SAME binding would break that, and is prevented by the
 * `organization_default_binding_exclusive` trigger (migration 0014).
 *
 * Residual edge: the admin api-key paths bypass the single-role lock, so a user
 * could be given profiles in two domains. That account keeps the owner from
 * whichever profile came first. Not reachable from self-signup, and fixed
 * properly by the per-profile `profile_origin` work in
 * `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-30-account-profile-identity-model-design.md`.
