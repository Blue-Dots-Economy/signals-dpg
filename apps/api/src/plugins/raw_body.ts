/**
 * Keeps the exact JSON bytes of a request alongside the parsed body.
 *
 * `peer_instance_guard` verifies an HMAC the sender computed over the wire body.
 * It used to re-derive that string with `JSON.stringify(request.body)` — the body
 * AFTER Zod validation, which strips undeclared keys and injects defaults. Any
 * such difference changes the hash and 401s a legitimate peer.
 *
 * That has bitten twice (`lifecycle_filter`, then `order_by`) and each time it
 * read as an unrelated feature bug, because the symptom is a signature mismatch
 * that names no field. Hashing the raw bytes removes the whole class: what the
 * sender signed is what the receiver checks, so adding a field to a peer request
 * can no longer silently break federation.
 *
 * Registered on the app rather than inlined so the peer-auth tests can exercise
 * the shipped parser instead of a copy of it.
