 *
 * One route, `/legal`, holds both documents. `/privacy` and `/terms` used to
 * be two routes rendering this same component and differing only in where they
 * landed the reader; they are now redirects to `/legal#privacy` and
 * `/legal#terms`, so an already-shared link still arrives at the right section
 * (see `app.tsx`). Where the reader lands is therefore decided by the URL
 * fragment alone — nothing about this page varies by route any more.
 *
 * Nothing in the rail navigates to another route: every entry is a same-page
 * anchor, because both documents live on the page.
 *
 * Signals has one audience (plus the `u18` variant, which this read-only
 * page does not surface), so unlike the sibling aggregator repo the rail
 * lists just the two documents and their sections — no audience grouping.
