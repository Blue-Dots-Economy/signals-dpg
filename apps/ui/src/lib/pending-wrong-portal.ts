/**
 * One-shot handoff of a wrong-portal bounce across the Keycloak logout redirect.
 *
 * Why this exists: when the domain gate turns a user away (they hold a profile
 * in a domain this portal does not serve), both login paths call `signOut()`
 * and then `navigate('/auth/login', { state: { wrongPortalDomain } })`, and the
 * login page turns that router state into the `auth.wrong_portal` toast.
 *
 * That works on the better-auth path, where `signOut()` is a local API call.
 * Under Keycloak it does not: `signOut()` → `oidcLogout()` →
 * `userManager.signoutRedirect()`, a FULL-PAGE navigation to Keycloak's
 * end-session endpoint. The await never resolves, so the `navigate` after it
 * never runs; Keycloak then returns the browser to `postLogoutRedirectUri`
 * (the site root) with a fresh document and no router state. The user was
 * correctly blocked and signed out, but landed on the logged-out home page
 * with no explanation of why.
 *
 * Router state cannot survive a full page load, so the reason is parked here
 * instead — same read-once localStorage pattern as `pending-consent.ts` and
 * `pending-signup-extras.ts` — and surfaced by `<WrongPortalToast />`, which is
 * mounted app-wide precisely because the landing route is whatever
 * `postLogoutRedirectUri` points at, not `/auth/login`.

/**
 * How long a parked bounce stays worth showing. The gap between parking and
 * landing is one Keycloak round-trip (seconds), so anything older belongs to an
 * abandoned logout — the tab was closed mid-redirect, or Keycloak never came
 * back. Without this, that stale entry would ambush the user with an
 * out-of-nowhere error on some later, unrelated visit.
