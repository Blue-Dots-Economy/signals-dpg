/**
 * The filter-scoped totals behind the browse bar's count (N5).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Three different quantities were being conflated:
 *
 *   1. items matching the filters                 (what the LIST counts)
 *   2. of those, the ones inside the map viewport (what the map PILL counts)
 *   3. of those, the ones that have a coordinate at all
 *
 * The map's filter bar was showing (2), so switching list→map made the count
 * change for a reason no label explained. The pill on the map already states
 * (2) — that is its whole job — so the bar states (1), and the (1)-vs-(3) gap
 * is reported explicitly.
 *
 * COST. Two requests per selected domain, both `limit: 1` — a count, not a
 * feed. `/discover` with no area gives (1); `/markers` with no bbox gives (3).
 * Cached at the browse tier, and only enabled when the caller needs it (the
 * list view already has (1) from the feed it is rendering).
 *
 * Facets are routed per domain exactly as in `useMapMarkers`: the server drops
 * a facet the domain does not declare, so counting without that routing would
 * report an inflated total for precisely the domains whose pins are excluded.
