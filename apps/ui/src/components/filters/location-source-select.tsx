/**
 * The location-source half of `LocationSelect`, for the MAP.
 *
 * #644 (spec D26) took the whole `LocationSelect` off the map row, and it was
 * right about the half it was reasoning about: a radius there is inert
 * (`useMapMarkers` scopes by viewport, never by `area`) and contradictory if
 * wired up (a 5 km circle inside a 40 km viewport paints an empty map with
 * pins just off-screen). But the SOURCE half went with it, and that half is
 * not inert on the map — it decides where the map opens (`focusPoint`), where
 * the "You are here" marker sits (`selfLocation`), and, via `focusNonce`,
 * re-centres the map when it changes. So the map had no way to answer "show me
 * around my current position instead of my profile" at all.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a `variant` on `LocationSelect`. Everything that
 * component does beyond these two rows — the radius field, its validation, the
 * `usesCenter` gate, the viewport row — has no meaning here, so a variant
 * would be a second component sharing only a filename. What it shares that
 * matters (the trigger's exact shape, icon-only below `sm`, the ticked option
 * list, "listed but unavailable, with a reason") is `OptionSelect`, and that
 * is what both build on.
 *
 * Only the ROW is different, not the control: same `MapPin`, same position in
 * the toolbar, same words for the two sources as the list's switch.
