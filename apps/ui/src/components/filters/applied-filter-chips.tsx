 * The applied-filter read-out (#645 §4.1).

 * Before this there was no single place answering "what is currently filtering
 * this list?" — domain lived in the sidebar, a second domain picker lived in
 * the facet panel, search lived in the app bar, and one rule hid whole domains
 * silently. This is that place.
 *
 * Chips are the READ-OUT; the facet panel and the app-bar search box remain
 * the EDITORS (spec §7.1). So this component formats nothing, owns no filter
 * state, and reports removals back to the caller rather than acting on them.
 *
 * It carries chips ONLY for constraints whose editor is elsewhere — search
 * text and facets. `sort` and `area` have their own controls sitting inches
 * away in the same row, and a chip repeating their value read as a duplicate
 * on screen ("Area Within 25 km | Within 25 km ×"). Clear-all lives in the
 * toolbar rather than here, because it must be reachable when sort or area is
 * non-default even though neither produces a chip.
