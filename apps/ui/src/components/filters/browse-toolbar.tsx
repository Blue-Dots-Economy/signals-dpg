 * `<main>`, so it is structurally pinned. See `toolbarSlot` there for why that

            Two independent reasons:

            1. It was INERT. `useMapMarkers` is called with the viewport, not
               with `area` — the map's radius comes from the bounds it is
               showing — so the control changed nothing on the map at all.
            2. It would be redundant and contradictory if wired up. On the map
               the VIEWPORT *is* the spatial filter; layering a radius on top
               of a bbox lets "Within 5 km" sit over a 200 km-wide viewport and
               render an empty map with pins just off-screen.

            Area exists to give the LIST a location constraint, because the
            list is the escape hatch from a map too dense to show every pin
            (#644, "Why the list still needs an optional area filter"). */}
