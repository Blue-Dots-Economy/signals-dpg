/**
 * The map's bottom-center count pill (#203 map-serverside-search §7 revised,
 * extended by Task 6).
 *
 * THIS IS THE VIEWPORT COUNT, and it is the only place that number appears.
 * The browse toolbar above states the FILTER total — how many items match,
 * regardless of location (#644 QA N5) — so the two answer different questions
 * and both are needed: "102 listings · 8 not on the map" up there, "94
 * listings" here.
 *
 * Shown to signed-out AND signed-in visitors. It used to hide its plain-count
 * variant when signed in, on the grounds that `ContentHeader` already showed a
 * count for those users. That header count was removed in #645 (it duplicated
 * the toolbar), and the toolbar's replacement is deliberately NOT
 * viewport-scoped — so leaving the gate in place left signed-in users with no
 * viewport count anywhere.
 *
 * Two variants share the slot:
 *
 *  - **Over-dense** ("{{count}}+ in this area — zoom in") whenever the
 *    viewport's true total exceeds the active zoom-band marker cap. Zooming in
 *    (which refetches per Task 5's padded-bbox/truncated-result rule) drops
 *    the count under the cap on its own, so the pill reverts without extra
 *    wiring here — it just stops being told `truncated`.
 *  - **Plain count** — "Showing X of Y" when some matches in view are not
 *    rendered (the viewer's own pins are excluded), else "Y listings".
