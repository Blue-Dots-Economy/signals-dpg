# Actually brings the local Signals stack up: env, infra, schema, cache
# clears, and the API + UI processes themselves. This is the executable
# version of `references/bringing-the-stack-up.md` — that file used to be the
# ONLY copy of this recipe, meant to be hand-transcribed by whichever agent
# was running the skill. A bare `run.sh` on a cold machine (nothing already
# listening) never brought anything up on its own: `stack-up.sh` only
# VERIFIES a target that is already live and gives up after ~40s if nothing
# answers, so a cold run's only outcome was a confusing failure with no stack
# ever started. This script is what run.sh now calls FIRST in that situation;
# `stack-up.sh` still runs afterward to do its own job (write the run's
# env.sh/marker, probe UI identity, read capability env) — see this script's
# own header note near the bottom about the division of labor.
#
# INVOCATION — executed with bash, never sourced (same reasoning as
# stack-up.sh: BASH_SOURCE and `local` are bash-only, the user's shell is

# 1) Env. Idempotent (delete + append).
#
#    ⚑ BLANK-UI GOTCHA #1 — the network id lives in TWO files. The turbo
#    wrapper (scripts/turbo-with-root-env.mjs) injects root .env into Vite, and
#    Vite gives that injected value PRECEDENCE over apps/ui/.env. A stale
#    VITE_NETWORK_ID in root .env silently overrides the UI, which then resolves
#    the wrong network, 404s on fetchNetworkConfig, and renders blank — even in
#    incognito, and `?network=` will not fix it. Set BOTH. Same for
#    VITE_SERVED_BINDINGS, or the UI serves the wrong domains.

#    ⚑ BLANK-UI GOTCHA #2 — VITE_API_URL. A .env copied from another checkout
#    often carries a stale LAN IP, unreachable now, so the UI's first fetch
#    (/network/schemas) fails and it hangs on its loading skeleton — which looks
#    blank/white in dark mode, with nothing in the console. Force both files to
#    localhost; root wins, so both must agree.

# 2) E2E-ONLY ENV — this is what separates a stack that can be tested from one
#    that merely runs. Without these the suite skips silently or asserts against
#    an empty inbox.
#      CREATE_TEST_OTP        every OTP becomes "000000", so login and guardian
#                             flows run unattended. Boot FAILS if this is ever
#                             set with INSTANCE_ENV=production — by design.
#      SELF_SIGNUP_MODE       'allowed', or the suite cannot create its personas.
#      NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_* ALL THREE, or getNotificationClient() returns
#                             undefined and the API sends NOTHING while looking
#                             healthy (apps/api/src/utils/notificationClient.ts).
#                             The sink ignores HMAC, so the key/secret are dummies.
#      SIGNALS_SEARCH_URL     points at the search stub so its envelope
#      + _API_KEY             recorder actually sees traffic (F7 — this used
#                             to be left unset, so run.sh warned about it on
#                             EVERY cold run even though nothing had ever set
#                             it. SKILL.md §6 already tells the reader to
#                             confirm this is set; now the recipe that brings
#                             the stack up is what actually sets it). BOTH
#                             vars are required — signals_search_client.ts's
#                             searchSignals() throws "not configured" and the
#                             discover BFF falls back to native if EITHER is
#                             unset, so URL-only would still route zero
#                             traffic to the stub. The stub only checks the
#                             key's PRESENCE, never its value (same as the
#                             notification key/secret above), so a dummy is

# 7) Start.
#    ⚑ The API must be a DIRECT node launch reading root .env. `pnpm dev:api`
#    spawns through turbo, which keeps a schema cache in a tmpdir step 5 cannot
#    reach — so /network/schemas returns empty and the UI goes blank. No
#    tsx-watch here either: re-run this script after API code changes.
#
#    ⚑ FULLY DETACH both launches — process LIFETIME first, output second.
#    A bare `&` leaves the dev server as a CHILD OF THIS SCRIPT'S OWN PROCESS
#    GROUP, not an independent process: whatever reaps or signals the group
#    this script is running in (a CI step killed for exceeding its timeout, an
#    agent harness tearing down a backgrounded invocation, a plain Ctrl-C at a
#    real terminal) takes the API and UI down WITH it — silently, mid-suite,
#    with nothing in either dev server's own log explaining why, because
#    nothing in that log ever ran: the process just stops. Confirmed live,
#    reproduced directly against this exact script: sending SIGTERM to this
#    script's own process group while a plain `nohup ... & disown` had it
#    running left the API mid-shutdown and Turborepo reporting "Force killed
#    Turborepo tasks: ui#dev" — `disown` alone only stops bash's job table
#    from `wait`-ing on the child or forwarding SIGHUP to it; it does NOT move
#    the child to a different process group, so a signal aimed at the GROUP
#    still reaches it.
#
#    `spawn_detached` (below) is what actually fixes that, via Node's
#    `child_process.spawn({ detached: true })` — which calls `setsid()` on
#    POSIX, making the child the leader of a brand-new SESSION (stronger than
#    just a new process group), with no shell job control involved at all.
#    Node is already a hard prerequisite of this whole skill (preflight checks
#    >=24), so this adds no new dependency, and there is no `setsid` BINARY on
#    macOS to shell out to instead.
#
#    Bash's own `set -m` (job-control/monitor mode) looks like an equally
#    plausible fix — it also gives a `&`-backgrounded job its own process
#    group — and was tried first. It does not work here: confirmed live, it
#    hangs the launching (sub)shell INDEFINITELY the moment there is no
#    controlling terminal at all — which is exactly what `nohup bash lib/run.sh
#    ... &` (this skill's own documented shape for automation, SKILL.md §5)
#    produces. Reproduced directly: the exact subshell this step used to
#    launch the API sat alive and idle for minutes under that invocation
#    shape, never returning, while the API it had already started was
#    perfectly healthy — bash's job-control machinery apparently tries (and
#    fails) to do terminal-related bookkeeping with no tty to do it against.
#    `spawn_detached` has no such dependency: it returns as soon as Node has
#    started the child and called `.unref()`, regardless of whether a
#    controlling terminal exists.
#
#    The SECOND, previously-reported symptom of the same underlying gap is an
#    output problem, not a lifetime one: `spawn_detached` also redirects each
#    child's stdout+stderr straight to its own log file (never inherited),
#    for the same reason `</dev/null` + an explicit redirect were tried
#    first — a dev server that shares this script's own stdout can make a
#    CALLER that pipes this script's output (`| tail -30`) hang waiting for
#    EOF on a pipe the long-lived dev server never closes, even though the
#    job itself returns control to this script immediately. Confirmed live: a
#    field run piped this way never saw its own "ready" summary — the UI
#    launch line was still alive, and only its stdout/stderr were missing —
#    for ~25 minutes.
#
# spawn_detached <cwd> <logfile> <command> [args...] — starts <command> fully
# detached (own session, stdio redirected to <logfile>, never waited on) and
# returns immediately. $! is not meaningful here (the node -e process itself
# exits right after spawning); nothing in this script needs the child's pid.
