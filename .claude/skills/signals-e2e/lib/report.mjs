// The five-section signoff (plus a 2b: Flaky, added by the field-test fix
// below). A Playwright list reporter answers "did the suite pass"; the
// question a signoff has to answer is "can this ship, and what did nobody
// check" — which needs the skips and the untestable surface promoted to
// first-class output rather than scrolled past.
//
// Sections, in this fixed order:
//   1. Working        — passes, grouped by suite. Deduped on (spec file,
//                        title) BEFORE categorisation — preflight runs as a
//                        dependency of both the api and ui Playwright
//                        projects, so every one of its specs would otherwise
//                        appear twice once results are merged.
//   2. Not working     — failures, GROUPED BY ROOT CAUSE (a shared, masked
//                        error signature), each group carrying a count and a
//                        conservative suite-defect/capability-gap/drift/
//                        unattributed tag — never a guessed product-defect
//                        tag. Ten specs failing on one
//                        collision read as one group of ten, not ten unrelated
//                        defects. Cleanup residue lands here too, as a
//                        synthetic entry, because a run that leaves rows
//                        behind makes the next run lie.
//   2b. Flaky          — specs that failed on their FIRST attempt and passed
//                        on Playwright's retry. Never counted as a pass, and
//                        never folded into section 1 — the retry did not
//                        resolve anything, it only hid the failure that
//                        identifies the bug. Carries the first attempt's
//                        error, not the retry's.
//   3. Known/expected  — specs annotated `@known`, so documented look-like-bugs
//                        (the map count below the list total, `x-uri` through a
//                        `$ref`) never pollute section 2.
//   4. Needs a human    — COMPUTED, never hand-written: every capability skip's
//                        reason, plus coverage.md's `human-only` block, plus —
//                        on a scoped run — one line per suite this run did not
//                        touch, worded "not run in this invocation". Deduped
//                        with `(×N)` counts, first-seen order preserved.
//   5. Coverage drift   — whatever `npm run coverage` found unmapped, passed in
//                        by the caller (that check lives in scripts/, this file
//                        only renders what it's told).
//
// Exit code is non-zero if section 2 (Not working) OR 2b (Flaky) is
// non-empty. A bare `test.skip` (no capability reason, no annotation) is NOT
// quietly dropped — `capabilities.ts` guarantees a reason for every
// capability skip, so a skip with none is itself a defect and is surfaced in
// section 2, not folded into "needs a human" where it would look like an
// intentional, documented gap.
//
// `buildReport` returns plain data (`ReportSections`); `renderMarkdown` is the
// only thing that knows about headings and bullet formatting, so a future
// caller (a Slack summary, a GitHub check) can consume the data without
// parsing markdown back out of it.
