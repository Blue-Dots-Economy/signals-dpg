# CURRENT foreground command returns — confirmed empirically on this host,

# that child as a background job and `wait`s on it instead of exec'ing it
# directly, because bash's `wait` builtin is special-cased to return AS SOON
# AS a trapped signal arrives, even though the child keeps running — the trap
# then fires immediately, without waiting for the child.
#
# That still leaves the child alive, so on_signal has to kill it itself — and
# it must send SIGTERM, never SIGINT/SIGQUIT: confirmed empirically that a
# non-interactive, job-control-off bash (this script, launched via `... &`,
# exactly how `/signals-e2e` is invoked) sets SIGINT and SIGQUIT to SIG_IGN
# for every `&`-backgrounded child BEFORE exec — that disposition cannot be
# changed by the child itself once inherited, so `kill -INT` on a backgrounded
# `npm`/`playwright` process is a silent no-op even though the kill call

# is opt-in per host (see stack-up.sh's E2E_REAL_SEARCH_URL comment), so its
# absence is expected on a target this recipe didn't bring up itself, not a
# failure. (F7) `bring-stack-up.sh` now sets it — and `SIGNALS_SEARCH_API_KEY`
# alongside it — pointed at the stub, so this normally reads as OK rather than
# warning on every cold run.
#
# BOTH vars matter, not just the URL: `signals_search_client.ts`'s
# `searchSignals()` throws "not configured" and the discover BFF silently
# falls back to native whenever EITHER `SIGNALS_SEARCH_URL` or
# `SIGNALS_SEARCH_API_KEY` is unset — so a URL-only setup would pass the OLD
# version of this check while still routing zero traffic to the stub, the
# exact "capability reads as enabled, records nothing" bug this function
# exists to catch, just moved one env var over. The stub itself only checks
# the key's PRESENCE (`Boolean(req.headers['x-api-key'])`), never its value,
# so a dummy key satisfies it, same as the notification key/secret above.
#
# If SIGNALS_SEARCH_URL points anywhere other than the search stub, the
# stub's envelope recorder sees no traffic and silently records nothing while
# the `search-stub` capability still reads as available — same shape of bug
# as the notification one above, just without the real-world-harm
# consequence, so it degrades to a warning rather than a hard fail when
# simply absent (a target this recipe didn't bring up may legitimately not

#     alongside expected/skipped/unexpected — playwright.config.ts sets
#     `retries: 1` deliberately (a real external-target flake passes on
#     retry), and dropping `flaky` here made report.mjs's `zeroExecuted` check
#     blind to a run whose only spec passed on retry (counted as 0 executed)
#     while section 1 correctly showed it as working.

# R6 (field-test fix) — written to the FILE ONLY here, deliberately not
# tee'd to stdout at this point. The field-test run DID print the report to
# stdout, but ~840 lines before the "report written to ..." log line — headed
# Playwright output and per-failure trace dumps buried it so completely that
# the agent read the file separately with `cat`, summarised it in its own
# words, and its human never saw the five sections at all. The fix is to make
# the full report the LAST thing this script ever prints — after the "written
# to" log line, not folded into the middle of a thousand-line stream — so a
# human (or an agent that's supposed to relay this verbatim, per SKILL.md's
# ground rules) cannot scroll past it.
